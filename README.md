This is referring to people who know what they're doing.
I won't bother explaining every single step you have to take to make this script work.

# What this is

So what this script actually does is spam invites to an account with multiple clients of yours.<br>
The result is making the victim's client completely unresponsive.<br>
This shit will literally not stop until you cancel the attack.

# Installation & Usage

### Setup

1. Install python 3.8 or later: https://www.python.org/
2. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create accounts on the same region as your victim (3 accounts should be quite powerful).
4. Skip the tutorial on each one of your accounts, so when you login you can see the client home page.

### Usage

* Run `python MAINFILE.py "Summoner Name" "Region"`<br>
Where `MAINFILE.py` is the main python file depending on your platform. For windows you should use `main.py`, and for macOS `main_mac.py`.

For example: `python main_mac.py "Kwsfour" "eune"`

<b>Available regions:</b> `eune`, `euw`, `na`
