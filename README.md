This is referring to people who know what they're doing.
I won't bother explaining every single step you have to take to make this script work.

## Run multiple clients

* <b>Windows:</b>
    * Run League of Legends with this argument: `--allow-multiple-clients`

* <b>MacOS:</b>
    * TODO: Use AppleScript

## Get port & auth token

* <b>Windows:</b>
    * Place `SimpleDebugger.exe` inside your League of Legends folder (where `LeagueClient.exe` is located).
    * Start SimpleDebugger and press `enter` to hook the client, then exit.
    * Now each time you start your League Client, the SimpleDebugger process will pop up and show you useful info.

* <b>MacOS:</b>
    * TODO: Create simple debugger for MacOS
